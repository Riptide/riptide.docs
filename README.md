# Riptide

Riptide is a super-simple multiplatform messaging-bus with built-in
- Thread-safe dispatch so you don't have to worry about concurrency
- Message correlation so your related messages can be handled together
- Multi platform implementations so you can have polyglot components
- Easy to use API which hides the complexity if message passing
